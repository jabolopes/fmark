  Fmark (Friendly Markup) is a very simple markup language without
  syntax, capable of producing PDF and XML files, and very simple
  document but sophisticated styling.

The first section

Hello, welcome to Fmark.
This is the first section of your document.

  The first subsection

  It is very simple to create subsections. No special characters are
  needed. Simply use indentation to indicate the beginning and end of
  your sections.

  The second subsection

  Another subsection with a different title and a [footnote in square
  bracket]. Again very simple.
